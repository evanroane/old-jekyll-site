Last week, I began the apprentice program at Nashville Software School. While I knew that my next career move would be to get into software development, I didn’t think that my path would include going back to school to do so. I have really enjoyed meeting the various members of my cohort, Cohort 7. Everyone has been incredibly cooperative and positive. It is wonderful how everyone brings a different background to our sessions and contributes the strength they gained in their experiences.

Over 10 years ago, I ran a Lord of The Rings movie fan site reporting on filming and set details, posting leaked images, and speculating on how the director would adapt J.R.R. Tolkien’s works to the big screen. To run this website, I learned some HTML, CSS, and PHP. At the time that I designed the graphic interface for the site, the thing to do was create the design in Photoshop and use Image Ready to slice the images into smaller .gif or .jpg files to be displayed in tables in HTML code. At NSS I have had to catch up with quite a few changes in web design including the shift toward mobile browsing and the overall shift from using tables to position design elements to using CSS and SASS. The web has come a long way in the last ten years, but in the last week, so have I.
