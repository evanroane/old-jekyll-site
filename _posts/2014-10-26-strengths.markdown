My teacher, Eliza Brock, recently reminded me to think about how important it is to be grateful for the strengths that I’ve come to possess. While patience has come to me easily, my ability to speak confidently at events has come to me with greater effort.

My patience takes many forms, but I enjoy its fruit most when it enables me to consider carefully what another person means to communicate. To me, being patient with others means that I not only need to listen to what a person has to say, but also that I need to imagine the thoughts and intentions that might lie behind another person’s words. I find that doing this makes me consider the person I’m working with in a charitable light and makes me ready to receive their contributions.

The confidence that I’ve gained in speaking in front of others was harder won. On the Meyers-Briggs type indicator, I am an INFJ. The “I” in this personality profile means that by disposition, I am introverted. Having this disposition means that I am more likely to be energized by being alone and, conversely, that being in larger groups can reduce my energy level. Over time, I have built habits that enable me to bridge the gap from my default disposition to connect more effectively with others. In the last five years of my teaching career, I have had a great deal of practice and habituation in reaching out to others on subjects that I enjoy and am passionate about. Even as I look toward my new career, I feel that overcoming public speaking jitters and getting clear on what another person means will serve me well as I work with colleagues and clients.
